# Chapter: Information Security

Information security refers to the set of principles and practices designed to protect information - data from unauthorized access, alteration, deletion, disclosure, transfer, or destruction. It's a fundamental area in the field of cybersecurity, focusing on three basic principles known as the CIA triad: confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

## Confidentiality

Confidentiality is the principle that ensures information is accessible only to those who are authorized to access it. This principle is crucial to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. In practice, confidentiality is often provided through data encryption, which transforms it into a form that can only be read with the appropriate key.

## Integrity

Integrity is the principle that ensures information is not altered in an unauthorized manner. It protects data from deliberate manipulations that could disrupt its correctness, as well as accidental errors or damages. In practice, mechanisms such as checksum and digital signature are often used to ensure data integrity.

## Availability

Availability is the principle that ensures information is accessible to authorized users when they need it. In practice, this principle involves ensuring the reliability and resilience of systems so they can meet access demands and withstand failures or attacks that could disrupt their operation.

Information security utilizes a range of technologies and practices to achieve and maintain these three principles. This includes data encryption, identity and access management, the use of firewalls, intrusion detection systems, conducting penetration testing, risk assessment, and the creation and enforcement of security policies.

In the following chapters, we will discuss these concepts and technologies in detail to provide a solid foundation for further understanding and practice in the field of information security.
