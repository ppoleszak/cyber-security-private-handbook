# Chapter: Threat Actors

In the world of cybersecurity, threats come in many forms. In this chapter, we will focus on four main types of threat actors: Script Kiddies, Hacktivists, Organized Crime, and Advanced Persistent Threats.

## Script Kiddies

Script Kiddies are hackers with little to no skill who only use the tools and exploits written by others. They do not create their own exploits and do not have a deep understanding of the systems they attack. Their actions are often chaotic and unpredictable due to a lack of understanding of the consequences of their actions.

## Hacktivists

Hackers, known as hacktivists, are driven by a cause such as social change, political agendas, or terrorism. Unlike Script Kiddies, hacktivists often have technical skills that allow them to carry out coordinated and complex attacks. The aim of their actions is often to draw attention to a specific issue or belief.

## Organized Crime

Hackers who are part of an organized crime group are often well-funded and highly sophisticated. These criminal groups often carry out ransomware attacks or data thefts for financial gain. Their actions are usually coordinated, and the attacks are well planned.

## Advanced Persistent Threats

Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are highly trained and funded groups of hackers, often backed by nation-states, with covert and open-source intelligence at their disposal. These groups are capable of conducting long-term and complex cyberattack campaigns targeted at a specific goal or organization. Due to their resources, APTs can maintain long-term access to the victim's network, often remaining undetected for a long period.
