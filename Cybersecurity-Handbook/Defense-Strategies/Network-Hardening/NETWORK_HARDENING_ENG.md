# Chapter: Network Hardening

Network hardening, also known as "Network Hardening", is the process of enhancing network security by detecting and eliminating various security gaps that could threaten the integrity, availability, or confidentiality of the network. This process involves a range of strategies, techniques, and best practices aimed at minimizing network vulnerabilities to both external and internal attacks.

## 1. Network Hardening Process

The network hardening process typically includes the following stages:

1. **Assessment and Analysis**: The first step involves a detailed network security assessment, which includes identifying all the devices, software, and protocols being used in the network. Potential weaknesses that could be exploited by potential attackers are then analyzed.
2. **Implementation of Protection Measures**: After identifying potential gaps, the next step is to implement various protection measures. These may include updating software and operating systems to the latest versions, applying strong passwords, configuring firewalls, and limiting access to specific network resources to necessary users only.
3. **Monitoring and Testing**: After implementing protection measures, it is important to regularly monitor and test them to ensure they are effective. This can include regular network scanning for potential gaps, monitoring network traffic to detect unusual activity, and conducting penetration tests.

## 2. Network Hardening and Cybersecurity

In the context of cybersecurity, network hardening is key to ensuring protection against various threats, such as DoS (Denial-of-Service) attacks, "man-in-the-middle" attacks, and intrusion attempts. Without proper hardening, a network can become an easy target for attackers.

## 3. How to Harden a System?

The system hardening process involves reducing the so-called "attack surface", or the set of all potential weaknesses and gaps that could be exploited by cybercriminals. These vulnerabilities can occur in many ways:

- **Default passwords**: Cybercriminals can use password cracking programs to guess default settings. This gap can be particularly large if the same default passwords are used on many different devices or user accounts.
- **Hardcoded passwords and other authentication data**: If such data is accidentally published or forgotten in the code, it can provide attackers with a "backdoor" into the system.
- **Unpatched software vulnerabilities**: Unpatched vulnerabilities in software and systems are one of the biggest sources of attack vulnerability. Although patching such gaps usually mitigates the problem, patches are not always available, and their installation can sometimes be complicated or costly.
- **Lack of access control for high-privilege accounts**: High-privilege accounts, such as administrator accounts, pose a huge risk if not properly protected. Attackers who gain access to such an account can have full control over the system.
- **Incorrect hardware and software configuration**: Incorrect system configuration can lead to serious security gaps. Improperly configured servers, firewalls, routers, or ports can be easy targets for attackers.
- **Unsecured network traffic**: Unencrypted network traffic or data stored without adequate protection can be an easy target for attackers who can eavesdrop on communication and gain valuable information, such as passwords or user personal data.

Additionally, the Center for Internet Security (CIS) provides current guidelines on best practice system configurations for specific use cases. CIS standards include over 100 guidelines for 25 vendor product families (Amazon Linux, Amazon AWS, Apple iOS, Apple macOS, Checkpoint Firewall, Cisco, Docker, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, etc.).
