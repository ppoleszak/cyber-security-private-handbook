# Chapter: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA)

## Introduction

The CIA model is a set of fundamental principles of information security that provides guidelines for the evaluation and development of policies, procedures, and technological controls aimed at protecting information.

## Confidentiality

Confidentiality is about ensuring that information is only accessible to those who are authorized. Encryption technology is a fundamental tool to protect confidentiality, but managing access rights and user authentication are equally important. A confidentiality breach can lead to unauthorized data disclosure, which can have serious consequences such as privacy violation, loss of intellectual property, or misuse of information.

Confidentiality includes two key components:

* Authentication, which includes processes that allow systems to verify the identity of users. These include passwords, biometric techniques, security tokens, cryptographic keys, etc.
* Authorization, which defines who has access to which information. It's important to understand that user identification does not automatically mean access to all data. Authorization mechanisms are one of the main ways to protect confidentiality.

## Integrity

Integrity ensures that information will not be altered or deleted in an unauthorized manner. Integrity control can include mechanisms such as version control, checksums, cryptographic hash functions, and digital signatures. A breach of integrity can lead to the introduction of false information, which can impact business decisions, security, or legal compliance.

## Availability

Availability ensures that information and resources are available to authorized users when they are needed. Availability control can include redundancy, fault tolerance, load balancing, backups, and disaster recovery plans. A breach of availability can lead to downtime, which can impact the operation of the organization.

## Implementing the CIA Model

The CIA model should guide your organization in the creation and implementation of general security policies and strategies. Implementing the CIA model is not just about buying specific tools, but above all, it is a way of thinking, planning, and setting priorities.

## Extending the CIA Model

While the CIA model is fundamental, there are additional principles and models that extend this basic tribunal. For example, in 1998, Donn Parker proposed a six-sided model, known as the Parkerian Hexad, which includes principles of:

* Confidentiality
* Possession or Control
* Integrity
* Authenticity
* Availability
* Utility

It's worth noting that the additional three points of this model are controversial and may be grouped under availability.

Another principle of security not covered by the CIA model is non-repudiation. This is a guarantee that a person cannot falsely deny that they created, altered, observed, or transmitted specific information.
