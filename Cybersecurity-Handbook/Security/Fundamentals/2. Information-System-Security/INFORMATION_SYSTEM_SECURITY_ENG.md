# Chapter: Information System Security

Information System Security is a specific area within the realm of information security, focusing on the protection of information systems - a composite of applications, servers, networks, and end devices that process, store, and transmit information. While it shares the core principles of confidentiality, integrity, and availability (the CIA triad) with information security, Information System Security introduces additional aspects such as authenticity and non-repudiation.

## Authenticity

Authenticity provides assurance that a user, system, or service is indeed what it claims to be. In the context of information system security, this principle often applies to the verification of the identities of users, systems, and services to prevent impersonation or unauthorized access. Techniques such as digital signatures and two-factor authentication are commonly used to ensure authenticity.

## Non-repudiation

Non-repudiation is the principle that ensures an action or event cannot be denied after the fact. This is crucial in situations where proof of an action (like a transaction or a communication) is required. Digital signatures, timestamps, and audit trails are examples of mechanisms used to provide non-repudiation.

To illustrate the distinction between Information Security and Information System Security, consider this simple analogy. Information Security can be likened to the principles and practices that ensure the safety of the contents of a physical vault (e.g., money or valuables), while Information System Security is concerned with the safety mechanisms of the vault itself (e.g., the lock and surveillance system).

Information System Security covers areas such as network security, operating system security, database security, application security, end-point security, and physical security. Each of these areas focuses on the protection of different components of an information system, reinforcing the overall security posture of the system. The succeeding chapters will dive into these areas, shedding light on their role in maintaining the security of information systems.
