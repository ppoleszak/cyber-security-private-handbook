# Chapter: Threat Intelligence Properties and Sources

Threat intelligence plays a pivotal role in maintaining digital security. Knowledge about potential threats, their sources, and their modes of operation is an invaluable resource for any organization. To understand how to effectively utilize these resources, we need to comprehend the key properties and sources of threat information.

## Timeliness

Timeliness is a key property of a threat intelligence source. Threat information must be up-to-date to ensure effective countermeasures. In the world of cybersecurity, where attack methodologies change rapidly, information from a few months ago might already be outdated.

## Relevancy

Relevancy is another critical property. For threat information to be useful, it must align with specific use cases. For instance, information about attacks on network infrastructure might not be helpful for an organization focusing on protecting their databases.

## Accuracy

The accuracy of threat information is tremendously important. Incorrect or incomplete information can lead to improper security decisions, which in turn can lead to an increased risk of attack.

## Confidence Levels

Confidence levels refer to the degree to which a threat intelligence source is certain about its reliability. Qualified statements about reliability can assist organizations in assessing how much they can rely on the information from a given source.

## Proprietary

Threat intelligence is often provided as a commercial service, where access to updates and research is subject to a subscription fee. Such sources often offer unique and valuable insights that are not available for free.

## Closed-Source

Closed sources refer to data that is derived from the provider's own research and analysis efforts, such as data from honeynets they operate, plus information mined from its customers' systems, suitably anonymized.

## Open-Source

Open sources refer to data that is available to use without a subscription. These may include threat feeds similar to the commercial providers, as well as reputation lists and malware signature databases. Some popular open sources include:

- US-CERT
- UKâ€™s NCSC
- AT&T Security (OTX)
- MISP
- VirusTotal
- Spamhaus
- SANS ISC Suspicious Domains

## Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)

Open-Source Intelligence, or OSINT, refers to methods of obtaining information about a person or organization through public records, websites, and social media. These techniques are often used to gather information about potential threats.
