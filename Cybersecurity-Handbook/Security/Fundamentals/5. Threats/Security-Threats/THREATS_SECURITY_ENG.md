## Chapter: Security Threats

### 1. Malware

Malware, short for 'malicious software', is any software designed to damage or exploit any computing system without the user's consent. We can break down malware into several subcategories:

- **Viruses**: These are programs that infect other programs by inserting their malicious content into them.

- **Worms**: These are self-replicating programs that use the network to infect as many computers as possible.

- **Trojans**: Programs that pretend to be legitimate software but actually enable the attacker to have remote access to the victim's system.

- **Ransomware**: A type of malicious software that encrypts the user's files and then demands a ransom for their decryption.

### 2. Unauthorized Access

Unauthorized access to systems and data occurs when a person or program gains access to resources without the owner's consent. There are several types of unauthorized access:

- **Brute Force Attacks**: Attempts at access by continuously trying to guess the password.

- **Session Hijacking**: The attacker uses the active user session to gain unauthorized access.

- **Exploiting Security Vulnerabilities**: The attacker exploits known security loopholes to gain unauthorized access.

### 3. System Failure

System failure occurs when a computer or application stops working correctly. This can be due to various issues such as:

- **Hardware Failures**: Such as hard disk failure or RAM failure.

- **Software Errors**: Such as programming errors or improper configuration.

- **DDoS Attacks**: Often lead to system overload which can result in a crash.

### 4. Social Engineering

Social engineering involves manipulating individuals into divulging confidential information or performing actions detrimental to themselves or their organization. There are many types of social engineering-based attacks, including:

- **Phishing**: The attacker impersonates a trustworthy individual or organization in order to trick the victim into divulging confidential information.

- **Pretexting**: The attacker creates a false scenario to obtain confidential information.

- **Baiting**: The attacker offers something enticing to tempt the victim into divulging confidential information or performing certain actions.
