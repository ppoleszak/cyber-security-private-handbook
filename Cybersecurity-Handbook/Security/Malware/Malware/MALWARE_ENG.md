## 1 What is malware? Definition of malicious software

Just as the flu has its seasonal cycle of infections, computers and mobile devices are under threat throughout the year. This threat is malware.

Malware, or "malicious software," is a term that covers all kinds of harmful programs or codes that can damage systems.

Unscrupulous, invasive, and malicious, malware seeks to infiltrate, damage or disable computers, computer systems, networks, tablets, and mobile devices, often taking partial control over the operations of the device. Much like human flu, it disrupts normal functioning.

The motives behind malware vary. It can be about profiting from users, sabotaging their work, expressing political convictions, or simply boasting. Although malware can't damage the physical hardware of systems or network hardware (with one known exception - see the Google Android section below), it can steal, encrypt or delete your data, alter or take over key functions of the computer, and spy on your computer activity without your knowledge or consent.

## 2 How to recognize a malware infection?

Malware can reveal itself through many different abnormal behaviors. Here are some signs that may indicate your system is infected with malware:

- Your computer slows down. One of the side effects of malware operation is slowing down the operating system (OS), both when surfing the Internet and when using local applications, the use of system resources seems abnormally high. You might even notice your computer's fan running at full speed - that's a good indication something is consuming system resources in the background. This usually happens when your computer is turned into a botnet; i.e., a network of enslaved computers used to conduct DDoS attacks, send spam, or mine cryptocurrencies.

- Your screen is inundated with annoying ads. Unexpected pop-up ads are a typical sign of a malware infection. They are particularly associated with a form of malware known as adware. Moreover, pop-ups are usually bundled with other hidden malware threats. So if you see something like "CONGRATULATIONS, YOU'VE WON FREE DIVINATIONS!" in a pop-up, don't click on it. Regardless of the free prize promised in the ad, it's going to cost you a lot.

- Your system crashes. This can manifest as system freeze or BSOD (Blue Screen of Death), which occurs in Windows systems after encountering a critical error.

- You notice a mysterious loss of disk space. This could be caused by an infected malware that takes up a lot of space on your hard disk, otherwise called bundleware.

- A strange increase in your system's internet activity. Let's take Trojans for example. When a trojan lands on a target computer, the next step is to connect to the attacker's Command & Control (C&C) server to download a secondary infection, often ransomware. This could explain the increase in Internet activity. The same applies to botnets, spyware, and any other threat that requires communication back and forth with C&C servers.

- Your browser settings change. If you notice your homepage has changed or you have new toolbars, extensions, or plugins installed, you likely have a malware infection. The causes are varied, but usually, it means you clicked on that "congratulatory" pop-up ad, which downloaded unwanted software.

- Your antivirus product stops working and you can't turn it back on, leaving you unprotected against the cunning malware that turned it off.

- You lose access to your files or entire computer. This is a symptom of a ransomware infection. Hackers announce their presence by leaving a ransom note on your computer, explaining that your files are encrypted and demanding a ransom in return for the decryption key.

- You are redirected to unexpected sites. If you click on your preferred search engine, but end up elsewhere, this may indicate a malware infection. The malware that does this is known as browser hijacker.

- New icons appear on your desktop. You didnâ€™t install or download these programs, but they suddenly appear on your desktop. This could be the result of a malware attack. More often, these unwanted installations are a side effect of downloading free software.

- Your contacts receive messages you didn't send. Malware can use your email to send spam to other contacts, which can spread the malware further.

## 3 What are the most common types of malware?

Malware comes in many forms. Here are some of the most common types of malware:

- **Viruses**. This is a type of malware that, once it has infected your system, attempts to spread to other computers. Viruses often attach themselves to executable files and spread whenever that file is run.

- **Trojans**. Named after the famous Greek horse, Trojans appear harmless, but they contain harmful code. They do not replicate like viruses, but they can be just as destructive.

- **Spyware**. This type of malware monitors your actions on your computer, often with the goal of stealing your personal information.

- **Ransomware**. This type of malware encrypts your files and demands payment for the decryption key.

- **Adware**. Adware is unwanted software designed to throw advertisements up on your screen, most often within a web browser.

- **Worms**. Worms infect entire networks of devices, either local or across the internet, by using network interfaces. It uses each successive infected machine to infect others.

## 4 How to protect against malware?

There are several steps you can take to protect yourself from malware:

1. **Use a reliable security solution**. You should always have a good antivirus program installed. It can detect and remove malware from your computer.

2. **Keep your software updated**. Software updates often include patches for security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malware.

3. **Be careful with email attachments and links**. Don't open an email attachment or click on a link unless you're certain it's safe.

4. **Download software from reputable sources**. Be wary of free software, as it may come bundled with malware.

5. **Backup your files regularly**. In case a malware infection occurs, having a backup of your important files can save you from losing them.

6. **Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication (2FA)**. This can prevent malware from gaining access to your accounts.

7. **Be wary of public Wi-Fi**. Public Wi-Fi networks can be a breeding ground for malware. If you have to use public Wi-Fi, consider using a Virtual Private Network (VPN).

8. **Use a firewall**. Firewalls can prevent some types of malware infections by blocking malicious traffic.

Remember, the best defense against malware is prevention. Regularly updating your software, being mindful of email attachments and links, and using reliable security solutions can help protect you from malware.
