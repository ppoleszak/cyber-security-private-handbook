# Chapter: Malware

## 1 What is malware? Definition of malicious software

Just as the flu has its seasonal cycle of infections, computers and mobile devices are under threat throughout the year. This threat is malware.

Malware, or "malicious software," is a term that covers all kinds of harmful programs or codes that can damage systems.

Unscrupulous, invasive, and malicious, malware seeks to infiltrate, damage or disable computers, computer systems, networks, tablets, and mobile devices, often taking partial control over the operations of the device. Much like human flu, it disrupts normal functioning.

The motives behind malware vary. It can be about profiting from users, sabotaging their work, expressing political convictions, or simply boasting. Although malware can't damage the physical hardware of systems or network hardware (with one known exception - see the Google Android section below), it can steal, encrypt or delete your data, alter or take over key functions of the computer, and spy on your computer activity without your knowledge or consent.

## 2 How to recognize a malware infection?

Malware can reveal itself through many different abnormal behaviors. Here are some signs that may indicate your system is infected with malware:

- Your computer slows down. One of the side effects of malware operation is slowing down the operating system (OS), both when surfing the Internet and when using local applications, the use of system resources seems abnormally high. You might even notice your computer's fan running at full speed - that's a good indication something is consuming system resources in the background. This usually happens when your computer is turned into a botnet; i.e., a network of enslaved computers used to conduct DDoS attacks, send spam, or mine cryptocurrencies.

- Your screen is inundated with annoying ads. Unexpected pop-up ads are a typical sign of a malware infection. They are particularly associated with a form of malware known as adware. Moreover, pop-ups are usually bundled with other hidden malware threats. So if you see something like "CONGRATULATIONS, YOU'VE WON FREE DIVINATIONS!" in a pop-up, don't click on it. Regardless of the free prize promised in the ad, it's going to cost you a lot.

- Your system crashes. This can manifest as system freeze or BSOD (Blue Screen of Death), which occurs in Windows systems after encountering a critical error.

- You notice a mysterious loss of disk space. This could be caused by an infected malware that takes up a lot of space on your hard disk, otherwise called bundleware.

- A strange increase in your system's internet activity. Let's take Trojans for example. When a trojan lands on a target computer, the next step is to connect to the attacker's Command & Control (C&C) server to download a secondary infection, often ransomware. This could explain the increase in Internet activity. The same applies to botnets, spyware, and any other threat that requires communication back and forth with C&C servers.

- Your browser settings change. If you notice your homepage has changed or you have new toolbars, extensions, or plugins installed, you likely have a malware infection. The causes are varied, but usually, it means you clicked on that "congratulatory" pop-up ad, which downloaded unwanted software.

- Your antivirus product stops working and you can't turn it back on, leaving you unprotected against the cunning malware that turned it off.

- You lose access to your files or entire computer. This is a symptom of a ransomware infection. Hackers announce their presence by leaving a ransom note on your computer, explaining that your files are encrypted and demanding a ransom in return for the decryption key.

- You are redirected to unexpected sites. If you click on your preferred search engine, but end up elsewhere, this may indicate a malware infection. The malware that does this is known as browser hijacker.

- New icons appear on your desktop. You didnâ€™t install or download these programs, but they suddenly appear on your desktop. This could be the result of a malware attack. More often, these unwanted installations are a side effect of downloading free software.

- Your contacts receive messages you didn't send. Malware can use your email to send spam to other contacts, which can spread the malware further.

## 3 Types of malware

There are many different types of malicious software. Here are the most common culprits in the rogue's gallery:

- **Adware** is unwanted software designed to throw advertisements up on your screen, most often within a web browser. Most commonly, it uses some kind of deception to either disguise itself as legitimate, or to make you think that you're installing something you want, while also installing the adware.

- **Spyware** is malware that's secretly installed on your computer and designed to monitor your activity and report that information back to the person or company that sent it.

- A **Virus** is a malicious software program that, when executed, replicates by inserting copies of itself (possibly modified) into other computer programs, data files, or the boot sector of the hard drive; when this replication succeeds, the affected areas are then said to be "infected". Viruses often perform some type of harmful activity on infected hosts, such as stealing hard disk space or CPU time, accessing private information, corrupting data, displaying political or humorous messages on the user's screen, spamming their contacts, logging their keystrokes, or even rendering the computer useless.

- **Worms** are a type of malware similar to viruses. The difference is that worms operate on their own without attaching to files or programs. Because of their ability to travel across networks, worms are often used to carry payloads, or packages of code that can perform actions on the affected system such as deleting files or installing additional malware.

- A **Trojan**, or trojan horse, is a type of malware that's often disguised as legitimate software. Once on your computer, trojans can enable cyber-criminals to spy on you, steal your sensitive data, and gain backdoor access to your system.

- **Ransomware** is a type of malware that essentially holds a computer system captive while demanding a ransom. The malware restricts user access to the computer either by encrypting files on the hard drive or locking down the system and displaying messages that are intended to force the user to pay the malware creator to remove the restrictions and regain access to their computer.

- A **Rootkit** is a type of malware designed to provide unauthorized, remote access to a computer system. Unlike viruses and worms, rootkits are not meant to spread. They are instead designed to secretly remain on the computer and provide a backdoor for the attacker.

- A **Keylogger** is a type of spyware that's used to monitor and record each keystroke made on a specific computer system. Keyloggers are often used to gain access to private data like usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, and other sensitive information.

- **Malicious Cryptominers** are a type of malware that hijacks a small portion of your processing power to mine cryptocurrency without your consent. It uses your computer's resources to mine coins for someone else, while you're left with the increased electricity bill.

- **Exploits** are a type of malware that takes advantage of bugs and vulnerabilities in the software running on your computer. Once an exploit finds a hole, it can use that hole to drop more malware onto your computer.

## 4 History of malware

Due to the diversity of malware types and the vast number of variants released online daily, a full history of malware would be too long a list to place here. Nevertheless, we can examine the trends in malware development over the last few decades. Here are the main trends in malware development.

**1980s and beyond**: The theoretical foundations of "self-replicating automata" (i.e., viruses) date back to a lecture delivered in 1949 by the renaissance man of the 20th century, John von Neumann. However, the history of modern viruses begins with a program called Elk Cloner, which started infecting Apple II systems in 1982. Distributed by infected floppy disks, the virus itself was harmless, but it spread to all disks connected to the system, exploding so violently that it can be considered the first mass outbreak of a computer virus in history. Note that this was before any malware for Windows PCs. Since then, viruses and worms have become commonplace.

**1990s**: Microsoft Windows began its long dominance as the most popular operating system in the world (not to be surpassed until Google's Android many years later). With the rise in popularity of Windows and its built-in applications, the number of viruses written for this platform increased. In particular, malware authors began writing infectious code in Microsoft Word macros. These macro viruses infected documents and templates, not executable applications, although strictly speaking, Word document macros are a form of executable code.

**2002 to 2007**: Worms spread via instant messages (IM) proliferated on popular IM networks, including AOL AIM, MSN Messenger, and Yahoo Messenger. Most attacks began with a social engineering trick. Attackers could send an IM that said something like, "Who's with you in this photo?" or "OMG, I think you've won the lottery!" along with a link to a malicious download. Once your system was infected, the IM worm spread further, sending malicious download links to everyone on your contact list.

**2005 to 2009**: Adware attacks proliferated, displaying unwanted ads on computer screens, sometimes in the form of a pop-up or in a window that users couldn't close. These ads often exploited legitimate software as a means of spreading, but around 2008, software publishers began suing adware companies for fraud. The result was millions of dollars in fines. This eventually led to the shutdown of adware companies. Today's tech support scams owe much to the adware of old, using many of the same tricks as the old adware attacks; e.g., full-screen ads that can't be closed or exited.

**2007 to 2009**: Malware scammers turned to social networks, such as Myspace, as a channel for delivering fake ads, links to phishing sites, and malicious apps. After the decline in Myspace's popularity, Facebook and Twitter became the preferred platforms.

**2013**: A new form of malware called ransomware conducted an attack named CryptoLocker, which ran from early September 2013 to the end of May 2014, attacking Windows computers. CryptoLocker managed to coerce victims into paying a total of around 3 million dollars, as reported by BBC News. Moreover, the success of ransomware led to an endless series of copycats.

**2013 to 2017**: Delivered via trojans, exploits, and malvertising, ransomware became the king of malware, culminating in massive outbreaks in 2017 that affected businesses of all kinds.

**2017**: Cryptocurrency - and the way to mine it - attracted wide attention, leading to a new malware scam called cryptojacking, i.e., secretlyusing someone else's device to mine cryptocurrency unnoticed by the victims' resources.

**2018 to 2019**: Ransomware made a big comeback. However, this time cybercriminals shifted their operations from individual consumers to business targets. Riding the wave of GandCrab and Ryuk ransomware infections, attacks on businesses increased by 365 percent from 2018 to 2019. To this day, there are no signs that ransomware attacks will slow down.
