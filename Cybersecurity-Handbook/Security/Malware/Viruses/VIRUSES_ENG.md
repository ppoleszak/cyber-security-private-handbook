# Chapter: Viruses

## Definitions

**Computer Viruses** are malicious codes that run on a machine without the user's knowledge and infect the computer once executed. Viruses require a user action to reproduce and spread. There are many different types of viruses, each with their unique characteristics and ways of infecting computer systems.

## Types of Computer Viruses

### Boot Sector Virus

**Boot Sector Viruses** are stored in the first sector of a hard drive and are loaded into memory upon boot up.

### Macro Virus

**Macro Viruses** are embedded into a document and are executed when the document is opened by the user.

### Program Virus

**Program Viruses** infect executable files or applications.

### Multipartite Virus

**Multipartite Viruses** combine boot and program viruses to first attach itself to the boot sector and system files before attacking other files on the computer.

### Encrypted Virus

**Encrypted Viruses** are viruses that hide their malicious data by encrypting it.

### Polymorphic Virus

**Polymorphic Viruses** are an advanced version of an encrypted virus that changes itself every time it is executed by altering the decryption module to avoid detection.

### Metamorphic Virus

**Metamorphic Viruses** are viruses that can entirely rewrite themselves before it attempts to infect a file. It is an advanced version of a polymorphic virus.

### Stealth Virus

**Stealth Viruses** are a type of computer virus that hides its presence by manipulating the operating system in such a way that standard procedures will not detect the infection.

### Armored Virus

**Armored Viruses** have a layer of protection that aims to confuse a program or person analyzing it.

### Hoax Virus

**Hoax Viruses** are false virus alarms that most often spread through email. While not harmful in and of themselves, they can lead to unnecessary panic and resource waste.

### Resident Virus

**Resident Viruses** infect applications on a host computer by infecting applications as they are opened by a user. A non-resident virus is capable of infecting executable files when programs are not running.

### Direct Action Virus

**Direct Action Viruses** access a computer's main memory and infect all programs, files, and folders located in the autoexec.bat path, before deleting themselves.

### Browser Hijacker

**Browser Hijackers** manually change the settings of web browsers, such as replacing the homepage, editing the new tab page, and changing the default search engine.

### Overwrite Virus

**Overwrite Viruses** are extremely dangerous. They can delete data and replace it with their own file content or code.

### Web Scripting Virus

**Web Scripting Viruses** attack web browser security, enabling a hacker to inject web-pages with malicious code, or client-side scripting.

### File Infector

**File Infectors** are one of the most common computer viruses. It overwrites files when they are opened and can quickly spread across systems and networks.

### Network Virus

**Network Viruses** are extremely dangerous because they can entirely cripple whole computer networks.

### Boot Sector Virus

**Boot Sector Viruses** attack a computer's master boot record (MBR). The virus injects its code into a hard disk's partition table, then moves into the main memory when a computer restarts.
