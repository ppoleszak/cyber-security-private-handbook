# Chapter: Worms

## Definitions

**Computer worms** are a form of malicious software, akin to viruses, but they are able to replicate themselves without any user interaction. Worms can cause disruption to normal network traffic and computing activities.

## What is a Worm?

A **worm** is a type of malicious software that differs from a virus in that it can self-replicate and spread without the need to infect files or require any user action. A worm does not need a host to spread, whereas a virus must infect a file or program in order to spread. Worms can cause a variety of issues, such as consuming network bandwidth, overloading systems, or even conducting DDoS attacks.

## Examples

One of the most famous examples of a worm is **Conficker**, which infected between 9 and 15 million computers in 2009. Conficker was particularly damaging as it could use a variety of methods to replicate itself, including exploiting security vulnerabilities in the Windows operating system, attacking weak passwords, and infecting removable storage devices.

## Differences between a worm and a virus

While both **viruses** and **worms** are forms of malicious software, they have several key differences:

- **Self-replication**: Worms can self-replicate without the need to infect specific files, whereas viruses must infect a file or program in order to spread.
- **User interaction**: Viruses typically require some form of user interaction (e.g., opening an email attachment), whereas worms can spread without any user interaction.
- **Mode of spreading**: Worms often use computer networks to spread and can infect large numbers of computers in a short period of time. Viruses typically spread through infected files and require the user to move the infected file to another computer.
