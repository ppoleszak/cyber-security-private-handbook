# Chapter 5.3: Eliminating the Risk of Multitenancy in Cloud Computing

## 5.3.1 Definition of Multitenancy

Multitenancy is a fundamental aspect of cloud computing architecture, allowing for the sharing of resources and services among multiple clients. In this context, "tenants" refer to various entities - companies, organizations, individuals - that utilize the same physical resources (servers, memory, data storage, etc.) provided by a cloud service provider.

## 5.3.2 Risks Associated with Multitenancy

Although the multitenancy model has several advantages, such as flexibility and cost reduction, it may also present certain risks. The actions of one client can affect others, particularly in terms of performance and security. For instance, if one client starts consuming an excessively large amount of resources (known as the "noisy neighbor" problem), it could impact service performance for other clients.

## 5.3.3 Eliminating the Risk of Multitenancy

The risk associated with multitenancy can be minimized by utilizing a fully dedicated, private cloud environment. In such a model, an organization has its own, undivided resources in the cloud. There are no other clients who can impact these resources, thereby eliminating the risk associated with multitenancy.

## 5.3.4 Practical Example

Imagine a Junior Java Developer working for a company that uses cloud services. This company utilizes a public cloud, meaning that it shares resources (servers, disk space, etc.) with other companies.

One day, the developer notices a sharp decrease in the performance of the software they're developing. Upon investigation, it turns out that another company using the same cloud resources has launched very resource-intensive tasks, negatively affecting the software's performance.

To avoid such issues in the future, the company decides to transition to a private cloud. It thereby gains its own, dedicated resources, which aren't shared with other companies. As a result, there is no risk that the actions of another company will impact the performance of the software, and consequently, the work of the Junior Java Developer.
