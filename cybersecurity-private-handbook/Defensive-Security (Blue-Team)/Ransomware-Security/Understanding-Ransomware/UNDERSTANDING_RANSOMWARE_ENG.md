# Chapter: Ransomware - A Multidimensional Cybersecurity Threat

Ransomware is a type of malicious software, also known as malware, that prevents access to files, systems, or computer networks, demanding a ransom for their return.

## 1. Basic Information about Ransomware

Ransomware is a form of malware that locks a victim's data or device and threatens to remain locked - or worse - unless the victim pays a ransom to the attacker. According to the IBM Security X-Force Threat Intelligence Index 2023 report, ransomware attacks accounted for 17 percent of all cyberattacks in 2022.

The earliest ransomware attacks simply demanded a ransom in exchange for the encryption key needed to regain access to the affected data or to use the infected device. By regularly backing up data, an organization could limit the costs of such ransomware attacks and often avoid paying the demanded ransom sum.

## 2. What is Ransomware?

Ransomware, also known as extortion software, is malicious software (malware) that aims to deny access to a user's data or systems, and then demands a "ransom" for their return.

### 2.1 How Does Ransomware Work?

The process of ransomware infection is usually quite simple but effective. Here's how it works:

1. A user unwittingly downloads and installs ransomware on their computer. This can happen by clicking on an email attachment, visiting an infected website, or even by downloading and installing software that seemed safe.

2. Once installed, the ransomware starts to encrypt the user's files. At this point, the user may still not know that they are infected.

3. Once the encryption process is complete, the ransomware shows a message, informing the user of the infection and demanding a ransom (usually in the form of cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin) for the decryption of the files.

Unfortunately, paying the ransom does not guarantee that the user will regain access to their data. In some cases, cybercriminals do not send the decryption key even after receiving the ransom. In others, the decryption process may not work properly, and the files may remain encrypted.

### 2.2 How Do I Know I'm Infected?

Typically, the easiest way to recognize a ransomware infection is by the ransom message that is displayed. However, there are also other signs that may indicate a ransomware infection:

- You can't open files that were previously available.
- Files on your computer have strange extensions that weren't there before.
- Your computer runs slower than usual.
- You receive error messages when trying to open files.
- You notice unknown processes running in Task Manager.

## 3. Types of Ransomware

### 3.1 Encrypting Ransomware (crypto-ransomware)

The most common type, called encrypting ransomware or crypto-ransomware, takes the victim's data hostage by encrypting it. The attacker then demands a ransom in exchange for providing the decryption key needed to decrypt the data.

### 3.2 Locking Ransomware (screen-locking ransomware)

A rarer form of ransomware, called non-encrypting ransomware or screen-locking ransomware, locks the entire victim's device, usually denying access to the operating system. Instead of normal booting, the device displays a screen with a ransom demand.

### 3.3 Subcategories of Ransomware

1. **Leakware/Doxware** is ransomware that steals, or exfiltrates, sensitive data and threatens to publish them. While earlier forms of leakware or doxware often stole data without encrypting them, today's variants often do both things.

2. **Mobile ransomware** encompasses all types of ransomware that affect mobile devices. Delivered through malicious apps or by download via networks, mobile ransomware is usually a type of non-encrypting ransomware, as automatic cloud data backups, standard on many mobile devices, make it easy to reverse encrypting attacks.

3. **Wipers/destructive ransomware** threatens to destroy data if a ransom is not paid - except when the ransomware destroys data even if the ransom is paid. This latter type of wiper is often suspected to be used by nation-states or hackers, rather than ordinary cybercriminals.

4. **Scareware** is a type of ransomware that tries to scare users into paying a ransom. Scareware can mimic a message from a law enforcement agency, accusing the victim of a crime and demanding a fine; it can mimic a real virus infection warning, encouraging the victim to purchase antivirus or antimalware software. Sometimes scareware is ransomware, encrypting data or locking the device; in other cases, it is a vector for ransomware, not encrypting anything, but forcing the victim to download ransomware.

## 4. Evolution of Ransomware Attacks

In recent years, ransomware attacks have evolved, encompassing double and triple exploits, which significantly raised the stakes - even for victims who maintain regular data backups or pay the initial ransom demand. Double exploit attacks add the threat of stealing the victim's data and leaking it online; adding to this, triple exploit attacks threaten to use the stolen data to attack the victim's clients or business partners.

## 5. Cost of Ransomware Attacks

Victims and ransomware negotiators are reluctant to disclose ransom amounts. However, according to the Definitive Guide to Ransomware, ransom demands have risen to seven- and eight-figure amounts. And ransom payments make up only a part of the total cost of a ransomware infection. According to the IBM Cost of a Data Breach 2022 report, the average cost of a data breach caused by a ransomware attack - not including ransom payments - amounted to 4.54 million dollars. Ransomware attacks are expected to cost victims an estimated 30 billion dollars in 2023.
